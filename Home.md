This is the repository that we will use for the second assignment of the course 2015-2016. This repository has a [master](/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/Laboratory-3-Restful-Web-Services/tree/master) and a [control](/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/Laboratory-3-Restful-Web-Services/tree/control) branch. The master branch contains the code of the laboratory and the control branch only the list where you must register your results. 

This is a *NOT* a speed competition. The objective is to complete [AddressBookServiceTest](https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/Laboratory-3-Restful-Web-Services/blob/master/src/test/java/rest/addressbook/AddressBookServiceTest.java) by adding tests that ensure that the use of HTTP verbs in the service is correct (e.g. GET is safe and idempotent, PUT and DELETE are idempotent but not safe, and POST is neither safe nor idempotent). In order to pass this lab you should:
- Fork this repository, and configure in a similar way as you did for lab 1
- _Master branch_: Complete the tests that are required.
- _Master branch_: Commit your code and pass Travis checks.
- _Control branch_: Update your corresponding row in [README.md](/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/Laboratory-3-Restufl-Web-Services/tree/control/README.md) with the link to your repo and the Travis badge for your master branch
- _Control branch_: Request a pull request only of your control branch

Ok, the above is relatively easy to do. Then, how to get the cumulative bonus of 5% in your personal score? It is obvious, improve existing code!
- First, make a proposal by adding a proposal in your corresponding row in [README.md](/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/Laboratory-3-Restufl-Web-Services/tree/control/README.md). For example, you can decide that it is interesting to adapt this code for use one of the evolving standards targeted at JSON API specification and documentation such as [swagger](http://swagger.io/), [RAML](http://raml.org/) and [jsonapi](http://jsonapi.org/). Then do a pull request of your _Control branch_. I can provide you a lot of ideas but I expect that you can also propose a lot.
- Second, if nobody has requested previously the same improvement and I believe that it is worthwhile, I reserve the topic for you by accepting your pull request. Otherwise, I will reject it and will provide feedback.
- Third, start to work on it; remember that I will check if there are tests that test your improvement and your code pass Travis checks.
- Fourth, when you think it is ready add a :gift: to your corresponding row in [README.md](/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/Laboratory-3-Restufl-Web-Services/tree/control/README.md). Then do a pull request of your _Control branch_.
- Fifth, I will review your contribution. If it deserves the :gift: I will accept your pull request. Otherwise, I will reject it and will provide feedback.
